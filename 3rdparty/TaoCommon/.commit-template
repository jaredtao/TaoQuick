# Remember to read http://wiki.qt.io/Commit_Policy
#
# Change log entry: If this commit adds a significant feature, fixes an
# issue or contains a behavior change that is relevant to others,
# add a change log entry. It can be multiple lines long and ends with an
# empty newline. Try to integrate it into the flow of the commit message
# to avoid redundancy.
# Use the module name to indicate the area of the change e.g. [QtCore].
# Optionally specify a class or subtopic [QtNetwork][QSslSocket].
# Other common tags are: [General], [Important Behavior Changes],
# [Platform Specific Changes][Windows][OS X][Linux/XCB].
#
# [ChangeLog][module][class/topic] description of the really important
# change that was just made on several lines.
